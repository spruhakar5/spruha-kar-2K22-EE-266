# Pre-read: AI Coding Interview

You've been shortlisted! Here's what you need to know to prepare.

## The Process

You'll have **90 minutes** to build a working application based on a problem we'll share at the start. Use Python or Java, any framework you're comfortable with, and any database.

After the coding round, selected candidates will be invited for a **30-minute explanation interview** where you'll demo your solution and walk us through your code and design decisions.

## What You'll Need

**Setup:**
- IDE/editor of your choice
- Git installed
- GitHub account ready
- Terminal access

**Tech Stack:**
- Language: Python or Java
- Framework: Flask/FastAPI/Django (Python) or Spring Boot (Java)
- Database: Your choice (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)

**GitHub:**
- Know how to create a private repository
- Know how to add collaborators
- Basic Git commands (add, commit, push)

**AI Tools:**
- You can use any AI agent or LLM you prefer (ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
- **Important**: We'll evaluate your prompting skills along with your code understanding and problem-solving approach.

## Before You Start

Make sure:
- Your development environment is working
- You can create and push to a GitHub repository
- You have a stable internet connection
- You're in a quiet space where you can focus

## How to Submit

1. **Create a private GitHub repository** named: `firstname-lastname-collegeid` (e.g., `john-doe-2024CS001`)

2. **Organize your code** in this structure:
   - `src/` - all your source code
   - `src/readme.md` - setup, API docs, sample requests
   - `prompt/llm-chat-export.txt` - your LLM conversation (if you used one)
   - `test-cases/test-cases.txt` - how to test each feature

3. **Push your code**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial submission"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Make sure your app runs locally before submitting.

That's it. Keep it simple, build something that works, and be ready to explain your choices.

Good luck! 🚀
